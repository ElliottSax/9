Analysis

We were tasks with determining if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

Results

 - The weather stays relatively stable throughout the year. At warmest, the average temperature is 74 degrees,
   at coldest, the average is 71 degrees. The hottest month is June, the coldest is December.

-  The coldest temperature is 56 degrees. Although the weather is relatively warm, relatively consistent, the coldest
   range, we might expect business to be slow on those days. The hottest temperature is 85 degrees in June. The hottest temperature
   in December is 83.

-  In terms of min, max and average, the temperatures stay within a relatively narrow range. As mentioned, the low of 56 
   seems like the most concerning, although still within the comfortable range.

Summary

- Temperature does not seem to be an issue in terms of business. Colder days, perhaps might be slower, although it's not
  terribly easy to predict which days will be colder. Perhaps it may be a good idea to multi task on those days and
  have things to do with less customers.
  
  Temperature seems to not be a big factor in terms of business. We would expect there to other, more influential factors.
  We may look at rainy days, which would seem plausibly to have more of a potential effect on business. In addition, perhaps
  a big driver of business might be vacation trends. Perhaps this would be worth looking into.

  The surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
